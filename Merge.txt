We can merge Branches from the terminal or from github. To merge a bbranch from terminal simply follow the commands: git checkout main / git merge <Name of branch you wish to merge with main> / git push origin main. In the other hand if you wish to marge a branch from github you'll need to open a pull request and merge pull request.
